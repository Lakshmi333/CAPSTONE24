Creating a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on Windows involves a few straightforward steps. You'll use the terminal within VS Code for this process. 

Here's a brief guide:

1. Open VS Code and then open your project folder where you want the virtual environment to be created.

2. Open the Terminal in VS Code. You can do this by going to `Terminal > New Terminal` from the menu or using the shortcut `Ctrl+``.

3. Create the Virtual Environment: Run the following command in the terminal. Replace `env_name` with your desired name for the virtual environment.

    python -m venv env_name

    This command creates a new virtual environment called `env_name` in your project directory.

4. Activate the Virtual Environment: After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it. To do so, run the activation script from the terminal. For Windows, the command is:


    .\env_name\Scripts\activate
 
    Your terminal prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment. 

5. Install Dependencies : pip install requests

6. Deactivating the Virtual Environment: deactivate

7. Select the Python Interpreter by using 'Ctrl+Shift+P' Select Python Interpreter and choose the venv environment you created for the project.
